Movies-Recommender
The code uses machine learning to build a content-based movie recommendation system. It processes movie data to extract features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew using text processing techniques. 
By vectorizing these features and computing cosine similarity between movies, it identifies similar movies based on their content. 
The system then recommends movies similar to a given title by ranking them using the computed similarity scores. Finally, the model and similarity matrix are serialized for efficient retrieval and recommendation.
